      <div class="about-title">Why are you a designer ?</div>
      <p>
         The turning point was in Tokyo.
         <%# I learned programming and felt that programming was fascinating, and hence, I committed myself to career transition as I finished the first year of doctoral studies in Linguistics. %>
         I collaborated with a UX designer closely.
         I learned that being a UX designer is inspiring since designers can identify people's problems and create solutions for them.
         I like studying people and the process of thinking solutions.
         <%# Also, I believe that my developing experiences help me make more detailed and better design deliverables. %>
         Therefore, I decided to turn my career path to UX design.

      <div class="about-title">What is your design philosiphy ?</div>
        <ul>
          <li>Empathy and focus - empathy with the users and place their needs first.</li>
          <li>Simplicity - less is more, I enjoy pushing myself to understand what is really important and designing simple solutions.</li>
          <!-- <li>Design for functional than the aesthetic - making a product useful.</li> -->
          <li>See feedback as a gift - Feedback helps me to achive better design, and to improve as a designer.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="about-title">Who are you outside of work ?</div>
        <p>
          I'm a writer. I write my thoughts on the various topics of UX design with short slides on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hung_yi_lee_/" target="_blank">instagram</a>.
          <!-- I like reading, with various topics including behavioral psychology, entrepreneurship and productivity. -->
          It's a good training for communicating concisely.
        </p>
      <!-- <br/><div class="about-title">What is your design principle ?</div> -->
        <!-- <ul> -->
          <!-- <li>Meet the users' needs -  focus on users throughout the design process. After all, the 'U' in UX stands for 'User'.</li> -->
          <!-- <li>Usability first - be intuitive, provide feedback.</li> -->
          <!-- <li>Less is more - reducing the operational and cognitive costs of the users. </li> -->
          <!-- <li>Consistency - to reduce the user's learning costs, the user's cognitive costs, and the probability of misuse.</li> -->
          <!-- <li>Understand accessibility - designerâ€™s responsibility is to make sure that his design is usable for as many people as possible. </li> -->
        <!-- </ul> -->
