  			<h4>Discover</h4>
        <p class="content-sub-title">User Insights</p>
        <p>To understand users' needs better, I conducted in-person interviews. The results can be summarized into 3 big points:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <b>Users worry about customizing their own smart glasses.</b>
            <p>Users with myopia worry about the lens.
            E.g. how to select the lenses with their prescription, what lenses they can choose, etc.
            Besides, users cannot imagine that wearing a micro computer on their face.
            They afraid that the glasses would be too heavy or uncomfortable.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Users want to learn more information about Norm Glasses.</b>
            <p>There are multiple companies producing smart glasses.
            Therefore, users want the main features of the smart glasses can be shown clearly to help them tell the difference efficiently.
            They especially want to learn different use cases of the smart glasses and tech specs, like cameraâ€™s quality, battery life, etc.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Users care about after-sale service.</b>
            <p>Users worry about the after-sale services. They wish they could learn the support before buying the glasses.</p>
          </li>
        </ol>

        </figure>
        <p class="content-sub-title">Competitor Analysis</p>
        <p>Next, I turned to study competitors to learn who the main competitors are and what are the differences between their products.
       Also, I studied some websites selling regular glasses to understand their checkout process.
       Please see the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-0NV9Bh2BG57etGiHLkmqdhvpL-6WKf1EN_l-ypuirk/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">file</a> if you would like to learn the details.
    </p>
    <p>There are some insights:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Creating a seamless checkout process to help users select suitable frames and lenses is important.</b>
          <p>Shopping smart glasses including many customization steps, like frame's colors, size, lens' materials, prescription, etc.
          Making the customization flow easier for users is crucial.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Having FAQ or support pages, and categorizing the problems is necessary.</b>
          <p>Users might have many problems with smart glasses, and thus, an FAQ or support page is necessary.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Providing different use cases for users would help them understand the glasses better.</b>
          <p>There's a competitor providing various use cases. Users can clear learn how the smart glasses help them in the daily life.</p>

        <p class="content-sub-title">Personas</p>
        <p>
          Based on the research, I created representations of 2 major user types:
          one is "<b>who is familiar with smart glasses</b>"; the other is "<b>who is unfamiliar with smart glasses</b>".
        </p>

        </figure>
        <p class="content-sub-title">Problem Statements</p>
        <p>Based on the research, the problems are further defined as follows:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>How might we make users understand Norm Glasses better?</li>
          <li>How might we help users buy the Norm Glasses online confidently?</li>
          <li>How might we help users easily customize a pair of Norm Glasses that fit their needs?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="content-sub-title">User Flows</p>
        <p>
          There are 2 critical flows on the webiste.
          One is "ordering flow for regular customers"; the other is "claim orders from crowdfunding website flow".
        </p>
        <p>1. Ordering flow for regular customers</p>
        <p>
          Customizing a pair of glasses is not easy for users. They have to set multiple preferences and needs.
          To reduce users' affordances, I split the options into different pages.
          Therefore, users will focus on less options at a time.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49815506288_3c5f649894_b.jpg">
          <figcaption>Fig.4 - Ordering flow</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>2. Claim orders from crowdfunding website flow</p>
        <p>
          Some users have ordered the smart glasses from crowdfunding webiste "<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/" target="_blank">Kickstarter</a>" and "<a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/" target="_blank">Indiegogo</a>".
          To allow them claim their order and customize their glasses, Norm needs to provde a flow for them.
          After providing the verification of the crowdfunding (e.g. email, order number, username), the users would be directed to the "orders" page.
          And they would see their previous orders and can start customizing their smart glasses.

            Customizing a pair of glasses is a complicated process.
            To make it easier, I designed a step-by-step process.
            It would make users focus on one thing and reduce the cognitive affordances.
            In addition, I named each step since it would be convenient if users want to go back to the specific step.
            Moreover, the sequence of the step is a big point. I put colors' settings later since people are likely change colors. Lens material and prescription are relatively invarient.
            Especially on the mobile screen, users don't need to scroll to the first step if they want to change colors' settings.
          </li>
          <li>I put the selection on the left side since it's important thing. People have "F-shape" reading pattern, so they can easily pay attention to here.</li>
          <li>I showed the price on the right side. Customers care money a lot, and therefore, showing the costs can make them understand how much they will pay for their customizations. It will reduce their anxiety.</li>

        <p>Once my high-fidelity prototype were complete, it was time to put them to the test.
        The participants were instructed to complete "order a pair of Norm Glasses" task and "claim the Norm Glasses" task.</p>
        <p class="content-sub-title">Positive feedback from the usability testing</p>
        <ol>
          <li>100% of users were able to complete the tasks without problems.</li>
          <li>100% of users could understand Norm Glasses after using this website.</li>

        <p class="content-sub-title">Rooms for improvement based on the users' feedback</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Some users suggested that it would be better if there's a screen shows they placed the order succesfully. To solve this problem, I added a page after checkout to inform users that their order have been placed succesfully.</li>
          <figure>
            <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49820236022_38cd7ee5d2_o.png">

          </figure>
          <li>Most users felt that claiming the orders after signing up was overwhelmed. They said that they don't want to fill any form after signing up.
        Therefore, instead of directing to the form, I added a reminder page to inform users that they can claim their order and customize the smart glasses at "Claim" page.
        They can go to that page anytime they want.</li>

  			<h4>Wrap Up</h4>
        <p>It's my pleasure to work with Human Capable. Working on this project has been a fun and great experience.
          Ordering a pair of glasses is not a easy task, and it makes me realize the importance of every step in the design process which impacts the results.
        </p>
        <p>
          The next steps for this project would be to collect more users' data to see more users' behaviors through the website and keep optimizing.
          Besides, how to make users feel more enjoyable during the customization process would be my next task.
